üêç Snake Solver ‚Äì A Puzzle-Powered Problem Cruncher

Snake Solver is an engaging and intelligent solution engine designed to tackle snake-based puzzles or pathfinding challenges‚Äîcommonly seen in games, educational tools, or robotics simulations. It mimics the movement and constraints of a virtual "snake" to find optimized routes, solutions, or configurations.

üß† Core Capabilities
Pathfinding Algorithms: Uses techniques like A* search, BFS, DFS, or custom heuristics to navigate grids, mazes, or constraint zones.

Constraint Awareness: Takes into account snake length, tail-following mechanics, and movement limits (e.g., can't reverse, must grow).

Visual Representation: Animates the solution process to show how the snake explores, grows, and reaches the goal.

Dynamic Environment Handling: Adapts to moving obstacles, shrinking areas, or evolving puzzle rules.
